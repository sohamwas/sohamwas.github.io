## ðŸ”¬ Research & Internships

### **AIÂ² â€“ ML Lab (Manipal University Jaipur)**  
**Undergraduate Researcher**  
*Jaipur, India Â· Oct 2024 â€“ Present*  

At AIÂ², Iâ€™ve been actively involved in several projects centered on LLMs and their internal behaviors. I co-authored a paper on **memorization in large language models**, where I led the development of evaluation pipelines and contributed extensively to analysis and writing. I'm also part of a 15+ member research group working on diverse AI problems â€” from literature reviews and annotation workflows to testing API and fine-tuned model behavior using GitHub-driven collaborative development.

### **AIISC â€“ University of South Carolina**  
**Research Intern**  
*Remote Â· Feb 2025 â€“ May 2025*  

I worked with AIISC on applying LLMs to real-world challenges in India's legal sector. My focus included deploying small Indic language models (via Hugging Face) and evaluating them on curated legal prompts to investigate **bias** and model behavior under different socio-linguistic contexts.
