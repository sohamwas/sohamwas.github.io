**Undergraduate Researcher**  
*Jaipur, India Â· Oct 2024 â€“ Present*  

At AIÂ², Iâ€™ve been actively involved in several projects centered on LLMs and their internal behaviors. I co-authored a paper on **memorization in large language models**, where I led the development of evaluation pipelines and contributed extensively to analysis and writing. I'm also part of a 15+ member research group working on diverse AI problems â€” from literature reviews and annotation workflows to testing API and fine-tuned model behavior using GitHub-driven collaborative development.
