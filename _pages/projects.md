Welcome to my **Projects** page!  
This is where I showcase things I’ve built or contributed to — ranging from hands-on research to real-world AI systems. I enjoy working on challenges at the intersection of **ML**, **product**, and **research**.


## 🧠 Memorization in LLMs (ASPT-ER)
🎓 Co-Author 

Developed a **novel prompt-tuning strategy** — ASPT-ER — to reduce memorization in large language models while preserving reasoning capabilities.

> ✂️ **30% reduction** in memorized content  
> 🔄 Retained **in-context learning** performance  
> 📊 Benchmarked on perplexity and degradation metrics  
> ⚙️ Tools: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Unsloth

### 🧪 Key Highlights:
- Engineered a dynamic prompt intervention pipeline optimized for **privacy-sensitive datasets**.
- Benchmarked multiple LLM configurations using **perplexity ratios** and **unlearning degradation curves**.
- Outperformed several state-of-the-art baselines in both scalability and **response diversity**.
