Hello and welcome!
I'm so glad you're here. This site is a snapshot of who I am - from the projects I’ve built and the research I’ve contributed to, to the areas I’m passionate about and what I’m currently exploring.

My main interests lie in the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but I also have a deep curiosity for research and love diving into complex problems to find meaningful insights. For the research side of things, I have co-authored a paper on Memorization in LLMs and am currently exploring KV Caching and Causality in LLMs. I am a big advocate for hands-on learning and team skills. I currently am working on a project about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Feel free to browse around - I hope this gives you a good sense of what I’m all about!
