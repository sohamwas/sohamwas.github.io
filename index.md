<h1>Hello and Welcome! 👋</h1>

I'm so glad you're here. This site is a snapshot of who I am — from the projects I’ve built and the research I’ve contributed to, to the areas I’m passionate about and what I’m currently exploring.

My main interests lie in the exciting world of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science**, but I also have a deep curiosity for **research** and love diving into complex problems to find meaningful insights. 

On the research side, I’ve co-authored a paper on **memorization in LLMs**, and I'm currently exploring **KV Caching** and **Causality in LLMs**. I'm also a strong advocate for **hands-on learning** and **collaborative team work**. Right now, I’m working on an exciting project around **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

Feel free to browse around — I hope this gives you a good sense of what I’m all about!
