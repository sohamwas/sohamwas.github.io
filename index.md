<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">
I'm so glad you're here. This site is a snapshot of who I am - from the projects I’ve built and the research I’ve contributed to, to the areas I’m passionate about and what I’m currently exploring.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">
My main interests lie in the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but I also have a deep curiosity for research and love diving into complex problems to find meaningful insights. For the research side of things, I have co-authored a paper on <strong>Memorization in LLMs</strong> and am currently exploring <strong>KV Caching and Causality in LLMs</strong>. I am a big advocate for hands-on learning and team skills. I currently am working on a project about <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>.

Feel free to browse around - I hope this gives you a good sense of what I’m all about!
